            <h1><b>Story of Us</b></h1>
             
            <p>It was Thursday afternoon when you came to me asking me to join you on some mysterious errand. Your mysterious plans were nothing new to me. </P> <br>

                <p> What could be this important on an average Thursday afternoon? This is what I thought to myself. </P> <br>
                
                <p> Instead of searching for answers, I decided to focus on my previous plans. </P> <br>
                
                <p> “I would love to, really, I would but I am busy with job applications.” </P> <br>
                
                <p> More than anything, my response was due to the fact I needed to focus on securing my future, since I was only a few months out from graduating. I had no room for frivolous adventures. However, you convinced me that the errand wouldn’t take long and that my job applications could wait. All you wanted was some company. </P> <br>
                
                <p> While looking into your emerald eyes, there was sincerity mixed with a bit of mischief, however I decided to rebel against my better judgement. </P> <br>
                
                <p> “Okay, you’ve got me for one hour max.” </P> 
                
                <p> You smiled as we hopped into your car. I turned to you as we began driving through the city which bled and passed over the barrier into the countryside. We kept going farther from our hometown. </P> <br>
                
                <p> “So, what are we doing exactly?” I asked. </P> 
                
                <p> “We’re going to watch the sunset and observe the stars!” he responded.  His eyes twinkled with excitement. </P> <br>
                
                <p> I should’ve known. </P> 
                
                <p> I didn’t even bother responding. I just shook my head and watched the changing of the skies, as the previous blue began to fade. </P> <br>
                
                <p> After 15 minutes, we arrived at an open field. The lush grass spanned for miles wet from early morning rain. The sky began to fade into a pastel purple as the clouds painted the sky. </P> <br>
                
                <p> As we sat side by side, nothing was said. We simply watched the sky fade until it reached its truest form of darkness.  We both sat there in awe. </P><br>
                
                <p> Within the darkness, stars began to glow and glitter in the sky. And the silence was the epitome of peace, as fireflies surrounded our presence dancing in the night. </P><br>
